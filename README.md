I worked on this assignment when taking Fundamentals of AI course- 3rd year, 2nd semester.

It contains search algorithms implementation for the Romanian Map found on page 83 of the book Artificial Intelligence, A modern Approach 4th Edition by Stuart Russel & Peter Norvig

Implemented algorithms:-
* ## BFS
* ## DFS
* ## UCS
* ## Iterative Deepening
* ## Bidirectional Search
* ## Greedy Search
* ## A* Search
* ## Centralties: Degree, closeness, Eigenvector, pagerank, betweeness
