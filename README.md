I worked on this assignment when taking Fundamentals of AI course- 3rd year, 2nd semester.

It contains search algorithms implementation for the Romanian Map found on page 83 of the book Artificial Intelligence, A modern Approach 4th Edition by Stuart Russel & Peter Norvig

Implemented algorithms:-
* ### BFS
* ### DFS
* ### UCS
* ### Iterative Deepening
* ### Bidirectional Search
* ### Greedy Search
* ### A* Search
* ### Centralties: Degree, closeness, Eigenvector, pagerank, betweeness
